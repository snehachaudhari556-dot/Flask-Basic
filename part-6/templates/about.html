    <h2>About This App</h2>

    <p>
        My To-Do App is a simple task management application built using
        <strong>Flask</strong>. It helps users organize daily tasks by allowing
        them to add, view, and delete tasks easily in a clean and user-friendly interface.
    </p>

    <p>
        This project was created as part of a learning journey to understand Flask fundamentals
        such as routing, template inheritance, Jinja2 templating, and responsive design.
        It works smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices.
